My attempt to pay it forward -- documentation and example applications that I wish had existed when I was trying to learn a given topic ðŸ™‚

I'm also available as a mentor on [mentorcruise.com](https://mentorcruise.com/mentor/ThacherHussain/), have worked as an instructor at [Galvanize](https://www.galvanize.com/web-development) for the Software Engineering Immersive Bootcamp, and as an adjunct professor at the University of Washington teaching Data Analytics and Visualization. Feel free to reach out to me directly with any questions at [thacher.hussain@gmail.com](mailto:thacher.hussain@gmail.com)
